Ethereal Toll Booth 
=================
Goals: The goal of this project is to allow payments between devices with a simulation of a vehicle passing through a toll.

## Flow
1. We choose to create an online portal and registry for vehicle owners to register their `Plate` strings, the unique license plate identifier for their vehicle. This is how most toll systems work now, a rider loading up their "Account" and then using it to pay tolls. In this case, we accept ETH and store a balance for the user. The online form can be used here: and connects using web3 to our private POA network, hosted on Microsoft Azure.
2. After successfully filling out the form, our smart contract mints an ERC-721 token, which keeps track of the unique Plate string, the balance of the vehicle, and the owner. There are transfers and approvals for if a vehicle owners lets someone else use their car, or sells it.
3. We can easily integrate with existing camera systems on tolls today by using web requests to our server for facilitating payment between vehicles. When a camera picks up any plate string, they can simply send our server at --- a request containing the toll booth number (for user validation), the cost of the toll, and the plate string.
4. A request for payment is automatically generated through the smart contract.
5. The driver of the vehicle entering the toll receives a notification at ---.  They have been requested to accept a toll of a certain amount and can confirm that they are at that toll booth easily. They can confirm payment without spending gas because we are using EC-recover to sign a validation.
6. Successful payments are emitted as events so everyone knows that the toll has been paid and the driver free to continue on there way to grandma's house.

## Implementation
You can connect to our private azure hosted ethereum network here: http://40.76.76.27:8501

You can register your plate and receive an ERC-721 token using metamask or any web3 browser app here: https://ethereum-toll.glitch.me/tollbooth This webapp also includes payment verification notifications. 

## What we learned
I wasnâ€™t a fan of private blockchains, until we got a private POA network running on Azure. It was super exciting to see the blocks getting mined and coming in as we were testing and making transfers. We follows [this]() guide, which had some phrasing issues and small mistakes (I made a pull request with some improvements [here](https://github.com/caleteeter/smartcontractdev/pull/2)). Geth was a lot easier than I thought to get running.

One of the biggest challenges I've struggled with as a blockchain engineer is making sure pick up all events off chain, so user experiences can be consistent and they don't need to know they are really using a blockchain.  So we decided to use Azure's Logic Apps to pick up all the payment request and payment success/failure messages, to connect to our user app.

We also used EC-recover for verifying signatures, for the first time and it was fun to try out these features in Solidity.

## Features
### Smart Contract interactions on the Ethereum Blockchain
- Vehicle owners can register their plate string and add funds to their account.
- Approved Toll operators can request the owner of a specific plate make a certain payment to the toll.
- Drivers can quickly validate payments without gas using their signature.

### Off-chain interactions
- A Toll booth can use Computer Vision to identify unique plate numbers as vehicles pass through the toll. This isn't strictly implemented in this project, but can be easily integrated with existing traffic cameras using simple web requests to our server.

## Project Recreation
1. Setup your own personal POA implementation of the Ethereum blockchain using Azure: https://github.com/caleteeter/smartcontractdev/blob/master/example1-setup.md
2. Run a web app (we used Glitch for this) which uses web3.js to provide an interface between Ethereum, the easily accessible web, and uses who want to make calls to our smart contract:
3. Deploy the Solidity Smart Contracts, found in `/contracts`, to the Ethereum Blockchain, We recommend using Truffle or Remix.
4. Setup Logic Apps in Azure to react to Ethereum events and pass to the webserver, currently hosted on glitch.
